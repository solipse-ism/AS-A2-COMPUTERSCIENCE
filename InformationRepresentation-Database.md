- ## Base Number system
	- Binary (prefix 2^10n)
	- Hexadecimal 
	- Denary (prefix 10^3n)
- ## Files
	- **File Header** (General)
		- File size
		- location of file
		- encoding type
		- compression type
		- File type/extension
- **Number**
	- **BCD**
		- Why use
			- easier to convert binary to BCD compare to Denary because range is 0-9
			- easy to convert between BCD and denary (low complexity)
			- real value calculation is harder to perform on binary (BCD is accurate to about 2 dp) -> can represent monetary value exactly
		- **Application** for each refer to one of the "why use"
			- financial application (calculation)
			  -> financial transaction use only 2 decimal place so there are no accumulation error
			- electronic display
			  -> visual display only need to show digit
			- Storage of Date and Time in BIOS of a PC
	- Two complement (one's complement + 1)
	- One's complement (binary number from subtracting 1 from each binary digit in a binary number) 
		- MSB represent negative. if negative -> inverse all bits to read the magnitude
		- Using it for subtraction doesn't make sense so we made two's complement
	- Sign magnitude (MSB represent negative and read magnitude normally)
- **Image**
	- **File header**:
		- Offset of the image data within the file
		- Colour depth/Bit depth used
		- image resolution/ image dimension
	- **BItmap** (when see sometimes use interchangeably, give both definitions) pixellation may occur, must be use for laser/inkjet printing, compress and get more reduction of data than vector(has less redundant data)
		- **Bit depth**: The number of bit per pixel
		- **Colour depth**: Sometimes use interchangeably with bit depth, however it is the number of colour that can be represent in an image
		- **Pixel**: The smallest element of a bitmap image
		- **Screen resolution**: The number of pixels which can be viewed horizontally and vertically on the screen 
		- **image resolution**: Sometimes use interchangeably with dimension, however it is the total number of pixel in the image (or dpi [pixel per unit measurement]determining the amount of detail of an image)
		- **image dimension**: The size of image in term of the amount of pixel high and wide
		- *Software Feature*
			- add text
			- resize and crop image
			- Fill enclosed area with colour
			- select area of pixels, using rectangle tool or wand tool(base on similarity of colour with variable tolerance)
			- copy and paste the pixels
			- using brush to change the colour pixels
			- applying effect: gaussian blur to reduce focus, changing brightness, contrast and saturation
	- **Vector** generally smaller file size, element can be independently altered/scaled
		- **Drawing Object**: distinct element in vector image define by mathematics(ratio of size and coordinates), property and shapes
		- **Drawing List**: List of all commands and property to draw all objects that make up the vector image
		- **Property**: define an aspect of the object's appearance (shape, fill/border/line colour, border/line style, border/line width, font, coordinates)
- **Sound** (how is sound encoded)
	1. The amplitude is recorded a set number of times a second (determining the frequency)
		- If higher *sample rate*
		  -> **sound recorded more often**
	2. Each amplitudes is given a corresponding binary number
		- If higher *sample resolution*
		  -> more bits use per sample (**more range of amplitude**)
		  -> each **binary amplitude** is closer to **analogue wave's amplitude**
	3. The binary number (of each amplitude) is saved in sequence
	- For *increase* in *sample rate* and *sample resolution*
	  -> **digital waveform** is closer to **analogue waveform**
	  -> **quantisation error** is smaller
	- **Sampling resolution**: The number of bits used to represent each sample
	- **Sample rate**: The number of samples taken per unit of time
	- **Sample**: Measuring the amplitude of the wave at regular/set time intervals -> measure amplitude and frequency 
	- **analogue data**: data value that are continuously changing
	- **digital data**: data value that is discrete and is store as binary and therefore can be interpret by computer
	-  *Software Feature*
		- edit start time, stop time and duration of any sound/timeline
		- extract/delete/save part of a clip
		- frequency, amplitude, pitch alteration
		- fade in/out of a clip
		- mix/merge multiple sound sources/tracks
		- combine different sources at various volume levels
		- pan between tracks/channels
		- use of filters
		- playback to speakers, processors or recording medium
		- conversion between different audio file formats
â€¢ etc... 
- **Text** (each has unique code, character replace by its code, code are stored in order to represent words/sentences)
	- Character Set: set of all the characters that a computer can represent where each has a unique binary or hexadecimal number
	- **Unicode** (up to 32 bits) UTF-8 is the standard, can represent many language and emojis 
	- **ASCII** (7/8 [extended] bits) only one language and is a subset of unicode
		- letter and number are stored in sequence
		- there are upper-lower case letter, punctuation marks, digits, arithmetic symbol and control characters for data transmission
		- code for upper/lower case letter differ after bit 5 e.g. A(1000001) a(1100001) B(1000010) b(1100010) so you can convert big letter to small letter by changing bit 6 to 1
- **Video** -> know FPS
- **Compression**: reduce file size so files load faster, can be sent into server with limited size, save storage space, reduce upload/download bandwidth, decrease upload/download time
	- **Lossy**
		- large reduction in file size
		- **exploit** human capability (frequency out of human range, colour that can't be differentiate by eye)
		- delete permanently
		- *notice* removing frequency from a sound file: this is done by changing the time (domain) axis into frequency domain before deleting and it is converted back to time domain
	- **Loseless**
		- Encode data in a different way so original file can be recover
		- **RLE**: represent data as the number of **consecutive** occurrence and the value
			- Not good for text as most text don't have consecutive repeat of character -> there may be increase in file size for storing that each character happens once
		- **Huffman coding**(for text or sound): analyse to find most use values and give shorter code for them(instead of 8 bits), turning original steam of byte into a bit stream. More frequent character get shorter binary representation {*notice:* code in a stream has to be differentiable, using 1 to represent 'something' is not suitable as we don't know where the code end}
- ## Database
- ### Why is database better than File base
	- Referential integrity is enforce
		- use of constraint and relationship: data validation, primary and foreign key
		- cascading update/delete
		- data is stored and edited in one place(using linked table, reduce data redundancy)
	- complex query can be run with data being complete and (accurate) due to referential integrity
	- data redundancy is reduce through enforcing referential integrity
	- reduce program-data dependency
		- program don't need to be rewritten each time
		- many program can access same data
	- security and privacy improvement
		- Views and access right of different user group, confidential data can be hidden from others
		- concurrent table/record locking: 2 user can update a record without overwriting or losing data
		- auditing to track ... and prevent
- **Terms**
	- entity: (sometimes used interchangeably with a table) an object that the data is stored about
	- table: all the data about an entity
	- record/tuple: a row of data in a table about one instance of an object
	- filed/attribute: a column in a table
	- Candidate key -> key that is unique and could be use as primary key
	- alternate/secondary key -> use for indexing, a candidate key that is not chosen as primary key
	- data redundancy - repeated data
- **Referential integrity**
	- ensure foreign key points to a corresponding primary key in another table
	- allowing cascade delete/updates
- **DBMS** everything is managed by **DBA**
	- Data Management
		- **Data Dictionary**: store metadata that makes up the structure of a database
			- Relationship: primary and foreign key
			- constraint: UNIQUE, NOT NULL, PK, validation rules e.g. data types
			- Tables and filed names
	- **Data Modelling**
		- **Logical Schema**: overview of structure of database which models a problem; independent of any DBMS uses method like ERD
			- Logical level: Describes how the relationships will be implemented in a logical structure of the database
			- external level: the individual views of database
			- conceptual level: see all views describe each views that a user may have
			- physical level: define how data is stored on a physic media
		- **Normalisation** -> reduce data redundancy
			1. need primary key, data is atomic, no repeated group of attribute
			2. no partial dependencies (on composite primary key)
			3. no transitive dependencies, no non-key dependencies
	- **Security** measure *particular* to DB
		- Views management
		- concurrent Table/Record Locking: doesn't allow simultaneous changes to a record so data is not overwritten
	- **Developer interface**
		- Creating: table, relationship, form(designing the buttons), and reports
	- **Query Processor**
		- Use SQL (DDL, DML)
		- Allow user to search for set-criteria and perform calculation (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
		- Execute queries written in sql to find and return result
		- creating relationship and constraint, defining tables and manipulating data
