- ## Primary Memory -> can be directly access by Processor
	- **ROM** -> read only -> store: BIOS, Bootstrap, kernel of OS(PC), operating software(embedded system) and mapped table of values (e.g. keyboard mapped matrix to ASCII)
		- **ROM**: flash once by manufacturer
		- **PROM**: flash once by anyone
		- **EPROM**: flash multiple time by anyone, remove entire data through UV(so need to be remove from device), data overwritten after removing only
		- **EEPROM**: flash multiple time by anyone, remove data through voltage and can be done by parts, so data can be overwritten. use *flash* storage
	- **RAM** -> volatile -> hold data of thing currently using (or progress data) -> has fast access time
		- **Static**: use *flash* storage (complex circuit) -> faster access time (no need to be refresh) -> use as cache memory 
		- **Dynamic**: use a capacitor and a transistor to store charge -> need to be constantly refreshed (use power) -> higher storage density -> cheaper per GB -> use in main memory
- ## Use of buffer
	- Act as **temporary storage**, *before use* by receiving device
	- allow different device/component to *operate* at **different speed** (e.g. different transfer speed/processing speed)
	- allow computer to transfer when buffer ask and then be use for other thing while waiting for a device which do task relatively slow
	- use of interrupt to indicate high/low watermark of buffer, this request for more data or ask to stop sending data
- ## Secondary Storage
	- **Magnetic HDD**: Longevity(slow degradation of data) -> cost least per gb
		- has several platter made with aluminium or glass, coated with ferrous oxide which is magnetiseable
		- platters are divided into concentric track and sector, the intersection between the track and sector is a block (a basic unit of storage)
		- these platter are mounted onto a central spindle which rotate it at high speed
		- the read/write head are just above each platter and are mounted onto an arm
		- electric circuit controls the movement of arm and the head
		- the data is encoded as magnetic pattern for each block
		- writing: variation of current in the head produce variation of magnetic field on the disk
		- reading: variation of magnetic field on the disk produce variation of current through the head
		- the whole mechanism is contain inside an aluminium box
	- **Optical disc reader/writer**: **durable**(not prone to damage by power failure, head crash, or exposure to water) -> **low manufacturing cost** -> slowest read/write
		- Drive motor is use to spin the disc
		- a lens focus laser (infra-red/blue) onto the disc
		- use a tracking mechanism to move the laser assembly
		- disc is made with plastic, coated with a layer of aluminium
		- disc has a surface arranged in long **spiral**(but **concentric track** on *DVD RAM*), which has a sequence of **pits and lands** that encode digital data; for *CD-RW/DVD-RW* the pit and land are the material that form after 'burn' process, **crystalline and amorphous**, the intensity of laser determine which material it will form when cool. This is call **phase change recording**
		- data is formatted into sector along the track like in magnetic hard disk
		- reading:
			- laser will be reflected differently from pits and land or crystalline and amorphous
			- the difference in intensity of reflection can be interpreted as 1 or 0
		- writing: 
			- more speed of rotation -> more data transfer rate
			- shorter wavelength -> more focus, more data can be stored
	- **Solid State (Flash) memory**: no mechanical component -> has no noise -> fast access 
		- use NAND or NOR gates structure: arrange in latches
		- there is a grid of columns and row where intersection form a cell, containing 2 transistor: control gate and floating gate
		- memory cell store voltage to represent 1 or 0, so movement of electron controlled read/write
		- Data can't be overwritten in same address unless first remove
- ## Input and Output
	- **Microphone**
		- incoming analogue sound wave cause vibration of **diaphragm** in the microphone
		- this cause a coil to move past a permanent magnet and generate current.'
		- Variation of amplitude determine the amount of vibration cause variation in current.
		- the generated current is converted by ADC for the internal processor to take sample of amplitude
	- **Speaker**
		- digital amplitude signals are converted by DAC to create electric current
		- This current is sent to the speaker which pass through a coil creating electromagnetic field
		- variation of amplitude digital data in time create variation of current and determine the direction and the polarity of electromagnet
		- the electromagnet is repelled or attracted to the permanent magnet causing a movement that vibrates the diaphragm and creates sound wave
	- **Touchscreen**
		- **Capacitive**
			- has several layers
			- the screen store electric charge and sensors on the four corner of screen detect for current change
			- when touched: charge are transfer onto finger causing capacitance change which sensor detects
			- **PCT** use circuit of array of capacity beneath screen which can detect touch of several fingertip
		- **Resistive**
			- has two charged plates with air gap between them
			- pressure cause the plate to touch and complete the circuit
			- This create a voltage divider in horizontal and vertical direction
		- point of contact is registered
		- the internal processor then calculate the coordinate of the touch upon receiving the signal
	- **Printer**
		- **3DP** commonly use are **FDM**
			- uses additive manufacturing: layer by layer, one layer at a time, starting from bottom using x, y, z coordinates
			- CAD is used to design the model and CAM is use to slice the model into layers which can be fed into 3D Printer through flash drive
			- the stepper motor control the x,y,z coordinates of the nozzles
			- the filament is fed into the nozzle, which is heated and pushed out
			- The filament is fused together layer by layer
		- temperature need to be control at right amount, using fans and sensors
		- **Laser Printer**
			- Revolving drum is electrostatically charged
			- Rotating mirror and laser is used to scanned back and forth on the drum and discharge particular points creating pattern which create an image
			- drum is coated with opposite charged toner which attract to charged area
			- electrostatically charged paper is fed into the drum and pattern on drum is transferred onto paper
			- paper is passed onto fuser to seal the image
			- excess charge and excess toner are remove and collected
	- **VR Headset**
		- sensors
			- accelerometer: detect orientation of head
			- eye tracker: to change the view accordingly making it realistic
		- controller for interaction
		- use of screen
		- use of headset -> HDMI suitable
- ## System
	- **Embedded**
		- combination of hardware and software dedicated to one function
		- contain a microprocessor chip
		- system does not have its own OS
		- contain firmware that is hard to be altered by user
		- does not require much processing power
		- integrated into a bigger system
		- **Drawback**
		- most use normal ROM: troubleshooting require specialist -> difficult to upgrade firmware -> can't be adapted for other task -> end up as waste
	- **Monitor**: 
		- Sensor: temperature, pressure, infra-red and sound
	- **Control**: 
		- Actuator
		- **Feedback**: enable output to affect subsequent input -> condition are automatically adjusted -> ensure that system operate within set criteria
