- ## System Software
- ### Operating system
	- Kernel is most always store in the ROM and is a part of OS that is always running in the memory
	- **Management**
		- **error and recovery**
			- management of interrupt
			- diagnostic and troubleshooter
			- safe mode boot
			- restore point/backup
		- **security** (through utility program)
			- backup
			- firewall
			- anti-malware
			- access right control and authentication
		- **file/storage** (using utility program)
			- file compression
			- provide file naming convention
			- maintain and keep track of FAT/NTFS
				- Each file allocation units (FAU) is being track for free space and what files is stored on them
				- maintain and keep track of directory structure
					- keep track of action like, cut copy paste, move, open, close, or writing of files
		- **memory**
			- allocate process to memory
			- only allow one address for one process
			- keep track of the block for unused space and regain them
			- manage the movement of data between the memory, processor and secondary storage
			- manage the use of paging/VM and partitioning/segmentation
		- **process**
			- scheduling of process (HL or LL scheduler)
				- keep track of priority and state of process(New,  ready, running, terminated, waiting, suspend)
			- conflict resolution of process trying to access the same resource, ensure fair access
			- allocates resources to each process and share data between process
			- manage the software interrupt of process
			- allow multitask
			- (breaking process into threads 'probably not a mark')
		- **peripheral**
			- managing the hardware interrupt send from device
			- control peripheral through process
			- keep track for peripheral device and auto install drivers -> plug-and-play
			- manage the power usage
			- management of queue e.g. when printing many files
			- management of buffer to allow different transfer speed and operation speed of 2 devices
		- Hardware computer interface: hide complexity of hardware from developer(when writing software) and user (through CLI, GUI)
		- Platform for application software to run
